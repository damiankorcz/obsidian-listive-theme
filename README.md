# Listive
> Outliner focused theme with differentiated header style and subtle interface for atomic notes with insight-based points

![Listive screenshot](Listive.jpg)

## Guiding Principles
- **Focus on making outlining a better experience**
    - as much as CSS can provide to support relevant plugins
- **Make insights prominent with differentiated headers**
    - to complement writing H4-H6 as insight gist
- **Minimise distraction through subtle UI changes**
    - No hard lines except for typography
    - Minimise distraction without disruption access to icons
    - Minimal colors used for UI, focusing on shades

## Features
- Custom font and spacing for Headers in lists vs in normal paragraph
    - By default, pairing H1/H2, H3/H4 and H5/H6
    - Custom spacing for Headers mainly for Reading View
- Color Schemes
- List Embed (inline "clean" block embed for lists blocks)
    â€“ made to work well in Live Preview (but still experimental)
- Auxiliary Customisation
    - Align left for Mathjax / Latex in Lists
    - Floating Action Button, adopted from [Obsidian You theme](https://github.com/selfire1/obsidian-you-theme)
    - (not yet ready) Mermaid
    - (not yet ready) Multiple Table Design
    - (not yet ready) Different background for Journal

> This theme is still work in progress. There are more features I have in mind -- those will be updated/released in due time.

## Companion plugins
Listive works best with the following plugins installed to enable more complicated features and give more control to refine the look and feel.
- **Contextual Typography** plugin for advanced layout features such as custom spacing for 1st para/list.
- **Style Settings** plugin for refining the look and feel including choosing/creating custom color scheme.

## Credits
- [Obsidian You theme](https://github.com) for the FAB I adopted (because I find it very useful when using on a phone)

## Support Me
I do this on my free time for personal joy. However, a cup of coffee or two would motivate me further! If you like what I do, and want to contribute back, you can support me via Ko-fi
